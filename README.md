# [py]thon doing [sw]arm [opt]imisation
A collection of swarm intelligence algorithms for general optimisation purposes.

This project is **WORK IN PROGRESS**. Stay tuned for future updates.

My aim is to provide a collection of all known swarm algorithms with means to solve various optimisation issues.

Due to my other work and the fact that I am not a professional programmer do not expect anything quick and anything great. But I will do my best! I treat this as a side project just for sheer programming fun, however I would want it to grow with time into something solid and useful. I will firstly try to implement some of the less common algorithms (like RFD or CS).

Any help will be greatly appreciated!
